lsi_decode_loginfo
==================

Decode LSI LogInfo codes to make troubleshooting slightly less cryptic

This is based on open sources, mostly Linux kernel header files. I'm aware of
an LSI document that details all the different LogInfo codes but it is not
provided openly. If someone happens to have contacts within LSI to help release
this document that would be very nice and would help many sysadmins around the
world to enable them to debug their storage systems better.

If the tool fails to parse the loginfo and you have an LSI product you can ask
LSI support to decode it for you, if you can then let me know about the code
and the explanation for it I can add it to the tool for everyone else's
benefit.
